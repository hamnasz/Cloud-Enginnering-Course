# TypeScript Assignment 02

## Introduction

This assignment consists of several tasks that involve using conditional statements to perform various operations such as checking numbers, determining age groups, calculating the number of days in a month, and checking leap years.

## Tasks

1. **Check Number Properties**

   - Determine if a given number is even or odd.
   - Determine if a given number is positive, negative, or zero.
   - Check if the number is divisible by both 2 and 3, either of them, or not divisible by both.

2. **Voting Eligibility**

   - Take the user's age as input.
   - If the age is 18 or above, ask if they have Pakistani nationality.
     - If yes, print "You are eligible to vote."
     - If no, print "Please obtain a valid ID to vote."

3. **Age Categorization**

   - Write a program that takes the age of a person as input.
   - Determine whether they are a child (0-12 years), teenager (13-19 years), adult (20-59 years), or senior citizen (60 years and above).

4. **Number of Days in a Month**

   - Enter a month (as a number between 1 and 12).
   - Print the number of days in that month. Assume a non-leap year.

5. **Leap Year Checker**
   - Check if a year is a leap year or not.

## Usage

- For each task, run the provided code or create your own program according to the given requirements.
- Review the output to ensure correctness.
